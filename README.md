# Advanced LSTM & DRL Trading Bot

## Project Overview

The Advanced LSTM & DRL Trading Bot is a sophisticated trading system that leverages deep reinforcement learning and long short-term memory (LSTM) models to predict market trends and execute trades. The bot integrates sentiment analysis of financial news, risk management, and technical indicators for improved decision making. This repository contains the implementation of the trading bot, along with test scripts, configuration, and usage guides.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Access to a virtual environment (optional, but recommended)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-trading-bot-repo.git
   cd your-trading-bot-repo
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configuration**
   - Set up your API keys as indicated in `USAGE_GUIDE.md`.
   - For a secure method, create an API keys file using the `scripts/security_setup.sh`.

## Usage

To run the trading bot, follow these steps:

1. **Load API Keys**  
   Make sure your API keys are stored as environment variables or in the secure keys file.

2. **Run the Bot**
   ```bash
   python3 src/main.py
   ```

3. **Testing the Bot**
   To ensure that all components function correctly, run the test script:
   ```bash
   python3 test_bot.py
   ```

## Features

- **Deep Reinforcement Learning**: Uses reinforced learning techniques for trading decision-making.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes sentiment from financial news articles using FinBERT.
- **Technical Indicators**: Implements various technical indicators for improved trading strategies.
- **Risk Management**: Calculates position sizes and risk assessments to manage trading behaviors.

## Dependencies

The project uses several Python packages, which can be found in `requirements.txt`. Some key dependencies include:

- `numpy`: For numerical calculations.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `torch`: For deep learning models.
- `transformers`: For sentiment analysis.
- `loguru`: For logging functionality.
